Annual Reflections

2024 - completed majority of Data Science BSc. Challanging year overall ton of new concepts regardless of them being foundational.
Mathmatics was most challanging have to relearn basics 
Stastitics was the most enjoyable for me and challanging
Python Programming was enjoyed its fairly simple but can be challanging. Was mostly eager to see its practical uses in Data Science
Learned MySQL basics. Enjoyed it alot powerful and easy to understand. Aim to expand knowledge for more advanced queries
Incorperated and began getting familiar with Kaggle, Github and the Medium into workflow
Study year or Study time was not recorded fully due to many inconsistencies with day to day life
Towards the end of the year from October progress stared picking up and logged roughly 500 hours from September - December.
Most of which was mapping study plans schedules, testing routines and adapting to new technologies such and github, jupyter notebooks, mysql ect.


YEAR 2025 
- Expected/Estimated study hours are aim for 3000 hrs (recorded using clockify)
- 1500 hours Pure/Applied Mathmatics  
- 600 hours Statistics/Data Analytics
- 500 hours Python
- 400 Hours MYSQL/SQLite/Postgres
- 100 Hours R_language
- 100 hours all else e.g. getting familiar with popular tools and technologies in DS such SPSS, pycharm and exta reading
