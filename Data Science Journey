Annual Reflections

2024 - completed majority of Data Science BSc. Challanging year overall ton of new concepts regardless of them being foundational.
Mathematics was most challanging purely because have to relearn basic rules and principles, mental arithmitic and thinking mathematically
Stastitics was the most enjoyable for me and but not as challanging as mathematics. Appling concepts to real work made mental mind amps and memory so muuch eaiser
Python Programming was enjoyed its fairly simple but can be challanging very quickly and was eaiser to remember the basics when comparted to SQL but much harder to master. Was mostly eager to see its practical uses in Data Science and analytics and ML
So i played acround with quantitavive analytical like central tendancy and spread. methods in python and quikcly reaslised the power of jupyter, python libraries for import such as nump and scipy. 
Learned MySQL basics. Enjoyed it alot powerful and easy to understand. Aim to expand knowledge for more advanced queries
Incorperated and began getting familiar with Kaggle, Github and the Medium into workflow. Still have yet to seee the power of github as a version control and collaboration tool
Study year or Study time was not recorded fully due to many inconsistencies with day to day life
Towards the end of the year from October progress started picking up and logged roughly 500 hours from September - December 2024.
Most of which was mapping study plans schedules, testing routines and adapting to new technologies such and github, jupyter notebooks, mysql ect.
As an amater self thought investor I aimed to use my investments to fund life: as a student and full time optimist I also hoped this would allowing for massive study hours of over 3000 recorded hours a year It was a great challange and very risky
I made great progress in researching finance and implementing realword finincial practice theories I created. 

YEAR 2025 
- Expected/Estimated study hours are aim for 3000 hrs (recorded using clockify)
- 1500 hours Pure/Applied Mathmatics  
- 600 hours Statistics/Data Analytics
- 500 hours Python
- 400 Hours MYSQL/SQLite/Postgres
- 100 Hours R_language
- 100 hours all else e.g. getting familiar with popular tools and technologies in DS such SPSS, pycharm and exta reading
