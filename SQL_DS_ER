SQL EXAM ROOM

  - INTRODUCTION
In the exam room (ER) Here we test your skills and knowledge old and new. Mixture of practical and theoretical. This is designed in a way to constantly add new topics, update and revisite old ones
Some answers are written on ipad as writing out a question and explaining thoughts help me commmit to a concept, or definition to memory
My methond was to study a block and attempt to answer the question. Revisit them days later and answer them again is will determin is I understand or am I just parroting my recent reads. 
My goal is to indentify weak areas and imporve overtime for example i expect to see short definiton paragraphs with more detailed explaination as I become more adept
